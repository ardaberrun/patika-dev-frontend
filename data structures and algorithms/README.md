### [22,27,16,2,18,6] 

## Write the sorting stages of the above given array according to insertion sort

    [22, 27, 16, 2, 18, 6]
    [2, 27, 16, 22, 18, 6]
    [2, 6, 16, 22, 18, 27]
    [2, 6, 16, 18, 22, 27]
    
## Big-O 

 $$
			 O(n^2)
 $$ 
 
    
##  What case does the number 18 fall into after the array is sorted? (Average, best, worst)

    Average Case
